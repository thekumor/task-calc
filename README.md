# Task Points Calculator
Quick app that allows to calculate points from tasks.

## Background
Some people write down what they did during the day. Sometimes, you want to evaluate how productive the day was. For completing each task, you’d get a number of points. Those points would then be used to evaluate how productive the day was.

## Description
This app contains an .html file which you run to be able to check which tasks you completed.

## Features and Functionalities
Each task has a record inside of a table. Next to each task is a combo box, in which you can select “-” if you didn’t perform that task, “+” if you did, “++” if you did that with an extra (not every task has an extra). Sometimes a particular task can be done many times (like doing projects or calling people), therefore some also contain a number combo box.

## Software & Hardware Requirements
A browser and a monitor.
